 ## Package Summary
    This package is for generating an numpy array of numbers that
    have been randomly selected from a user-specified probability
    distribution.

    You can generate a list of random numbers by calling
    the get_random_numbers function, found in functions.py.
    Alternatively, there is a class for each supported distribution,
    found in Classes.py, where each class has a .draw method
    that generates an array of random numbers.

    Note: This package only supports the Normal,
    Binomial and Poisson distributions at this time.

    This package also has a test unit (UnitTest)
    that can be executed by running either "nosetests" or
    "python -m unittests" from the command line after installation.

 ## Deployment
  1. Create a virtual environment (virtualenv is recommended)
  2. Install package - pip install randomnumbers.tar.gz

 ## Requirements
    Please see requirements.txt for all dependencies required to deploy
